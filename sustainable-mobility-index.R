# The goal of the script is to implement the methodology of the Sustainable Mobility Index in Lithuania. 
# It will create an index for each municipality at a national level and within each class.  
# The index will be based on the following categories: 
# - Environmental Impact
# - Incentives and Policies 
# - Cycling 
# - Public Transport 
# - Walking 
# - Cars: Fossil Fuels 
# - Cars: Electric and Alternative Fuels 
# - Use of Space 
# We apply a min-max normalization to each variable. 
# Then we calculate the weighted average of the variables for each category. 
# Finally, we calculate the Sustainable Mobility Index as a weighted sum of the categories. 
lt_synthetic <- read.xlsx("lithuania_mobility_synthetic_60_classed_v2_for_software.xlsx") 

# In this code chunk, we will transform the data from wide to long format and assign the categories to each variable. 
# We will get the variable names after pivoting the data using pivot_longer and use those to assign the categories. 
# The categories are assigned based on the variable names to the following categories: 
# - Environmental Impact
# - Incentives and Policies
# - Cycling
# - Public Transport
# - Walking
# - Cars: Fossil Fuels
# - Cars: Electric and Alternative Fuels
# - Use of Space
